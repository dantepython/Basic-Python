# BasicPython
### Quick description
Just a few python codes that teach the basic features of coding in py. You can use it to teach students or if you're learning python, you can learn from the codes. I am also using this to complement my portfolio, and show my knowledge of the fundamentals.
The files will be separated by the subject and also by "learning chronology", by the subjects you got to learn first.
Have fun, and you're fully available to copy the code if you would like to. (Credits are accepted though)
